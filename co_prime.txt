Problem:
    You are provided with two integers, a and b. Your task is to 
    write a Python function that checks whether both a and b are 
    co-prime or not. Two numbers are said to be co-prime or mutually 
    prime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1. 
    The expected complexity is O(sqrt (max(a,b))).
    
    For example:
    In the first example, the only positive integer that divides both 15 
    and 28 is 1; hence, they are co-prime. However, in the second example, 
    12 and 18 are divisible by 2 and 3; thus, they are not co-prime.

Tests:
    (15, 28) True
    (12, 18) False
    (1, 1) True
    (35, 49) False
    (8, 25) True
    (10000, 9999) True
    (6389, 3762) True
    (4638, 4799) True
    (5785, 9186) True
    (2167, 2183) True
    (14, 49) False
    (30, 45) False
    (22, 77) False
    (42, 56) False
    (60, 90) False
    (17, 51) False

Hint:
    To determine if two numbers are co-prime, 
    you can use the concept of the greatest common 
    divisor (GCD). If the GCD of two numbers is 1, 
    they are co-prime.
